This web portal running on django allows you to do several cloudy things on top  of your virtualproviders(rhev/ovirt/vsphere), physical(ilo) plus foreman and cobbler/satellite
VMs can be created,stopped,started, and their console access (ovirt/rhev only)
VMS get created based on predefined profiles ( with a given virtualprovider and optional foremanprovider and cobblerprovider, and vm details such as disksize ( 2 disks supported), net interfaces ( 4 nets supported ) ,...)

Installation 
---------
     
     uncompress the tar where you plan to serve it from apache ( ex: /var/www/nuages ). I ll call that NUAGES_PATH from now on 

     edit $NUAGES_PATH/django.wsgi to reflect correct location  (replace /var/www/nuages if necessary)                                                       

     create a virtual host conf for apache. you can use the nuages.conf.apache 

     
Usage
---------

     access the /admin page to :
                *create local users
                *create ldap user providers 
                *create virtualproviders
                *create physicalproviders
                *create foremanproviders
                *create cobblerproviders
                *create default
                *create profiles

     access the /nuages page to :
                *access the storage tab and browse your virtualproviders so storage information gets automatically created
     
     you can then begin creating vms or manage existing ones from the allvms tabs
